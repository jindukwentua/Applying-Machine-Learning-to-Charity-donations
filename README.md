## Question
You have been hired to deliver actionable insight to support a client who is a national charitable 
organisation. The client seeks to use the results of a previous postcard mail solicitation for donations to 
improve outcome in the next campaign. You want to determine which of the individuals in their mailing 
database have characteristics similar to those of your most profitable donors. By soliciting only these 
people, your client can spend less money on the solicitation effort and more money on charitable concerns

## Goal
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques on data collected for the KDD 98 competition to help a fictional charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

## Process
For the purpose of this project, I used 2 supervised machine learning methods. I compared several classification and regression models on how well they are able to identify future donors and estimate how much they will donate. These models were used to predict the outcome of the next campaign.
